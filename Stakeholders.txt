üîç QUESTIONS FROM STAKEHOLDER:

1. What are effective locations to focus on?

    We should focus on locations where aircraft parts are more likely to need replacement, 
    such as regions with harsh climates (like deserts or hot areas), long-haul routes, and high-frequency operations. 
    These areas create more wear and tear on aircraft systems. By targeting regions like the Middle East, coastal zones, 
    and high-traffic European routes, we can offer parts that match their needs and increase our sales.

2. Who are the clients we are focusing on?

    Our main clients include regional airlines, cargo airlines, and possibly military operators. 
    Each type has different priorities: regional airlines care about low cost and long-lasting parts, 
    cargo airlines focus on reliability and performance under tough conditions, and military clients often need specialized high-risk parts. 
    Knowing who we‚Äôre selling to helps us suggest the right parts and create targeted offers.

3. What are the air system categories?

    Air system categories include things like electrical, hydraulic, and pneumatic systems. 
    By checking which categories are used most often or replaced frequently, we can understand which parts are in high demand. 
    This helps us stock and promote the right products ‚Äî for example, if hydraulic systems are most replaced, 
    we push those parts more in marketing and sales.

4. What is the highest replacement parts name?

    Parts like tires, brakes, and seals tend to have the highest replacement rates because they undergo the most wear and tear during operations. 
    For example, tires and brakes face constant stress from takeoffs and landings, 
    while seals ensure airtight and fluid-tight conditions that degrade over time. 
    Focusing on these high-demand parts in sales campaigns can significantly increase turnover and customer satisfaction.

5. What are my best-selling and worst-selling products?

    This helps you know what‚Äôs working and what‚Äôs not. You can promote your best-sellers even more, 
    bundle them with slow movers, or stop selling underperforming parts.
    Action: Focus marketing and inventory on high performers and fix or replace low performers.

6. Who are my top customers and what are they buying?

    Identifying your top clients shows you who to keep happy and what they prefer. You can build strong relationships, 
    offer them better deals, or upsell related parts.
    Action: Create loyalty programs or targeted offers for top clients to boost repeat purchases.

7. Which regions or customer segments generate the most revenue?

    This shows you where your money is coming from. It helps you focus sales efforts on the most profitable markets or 
    types of clients (like cargo vs regional airlines).
    Action: Invest in regions and client types that bring the highest returns.
