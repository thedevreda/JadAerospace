#  We use Aircraft_Incident_Dataset dataset to understand what's damage the parts more and also to create air system catogires 
   so we can list the items on it 

# By Using AI we finally made a dics , also we add:
  Risk Level: to filter which air system category damage more 
  Replacement Interval: to show the general period replacement of each parts

# As we know Jadaero has his own partners like boeing...etc based on that we choose it as our targets 
  boeing_targets: we know that the most of fleets boeing made them 
  bombardier_targets: also bomb has DHC fleet and CRJ fleet one of biggest fleets makers
