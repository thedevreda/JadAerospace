Your Parts Analysis:

Flight Controls (leak-prone parts) - Critical safety items
Avionics Transducers - High-tech components with 2-year replacement cycles
Landing Gear (nose tires) - High-wear consumables with 200-300 landing cycles
Fuel System Gaskets - Long-term maintenance items (10-year cycles)

Target Strategy by Aircraft Type:
Boeing Operators (since you work with Boeing):

737 Fleet Operators: Southwest, Ryanair, American Airlines - high utilization means frequent tire/gasket replacements
777/787 Operators: Emirates, Qatar Airways, United - need sophisticated avionics components
Cargo Airlines: FedEx, UPS - heavy landing gear wear from frequent operations

Bombardier Focus:

Regional Airlines: SkyWest, Republic Airways, Jazz Aviation
Business Aviation: NetJets, Flexjet for CRJ series parts

MRO Targets by Specialization:

Heavy Maintenance: Lufthansa Technik, Air France Industries, Singapore Technologies
Component Repair: AAR Corp, StandardAero (for your avionics transducers)
Landing Gear Specialists: Safran Landing Systems service centers
Quick-turn MROs: Timco, ST Aerospace (for consumables like tires)

Geographic Targeting:

High-frequency routes (Europe-Middle East, US domestic) = more tire replacements
Harsh environments (desert, coastal) = more fuel system seal degradation
Older fleets = more avionics upgrades needed
