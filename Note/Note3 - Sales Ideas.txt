nvoice Ninja allows you to export reports as CSV files with customizable columns ReadthedocsInvoiceninja, including:

Client data and payment histories
Invoice and payment reports
Expense tracking data
Project and time tracking data
Product/service performance data

How to Use This Data to Improve Sales:
1. Customer Analysis & Segmentation
python# Analyze your exported client data
import pandas as pd

# Load exported data
clients_df = pd.read_csv('invoice_ninja_clients.csv')
invoices_df = pd.read_csv('invoice_ninja_invoices.csv')

# Customer lifetime value analysis
customer_value = invoices_df.groupby('client_id').agg({
    'amount': ['sum', 'mean', 'count'],
    'date': ['min', 'max']
}).round(2)

# Identify high-value customers
top_customers = customer_value.sort_values(('amount', 'sum'), ascending=False).head(20)
2. Sales Performance Tracking
python# Monthly sales trends
invoices_df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(invoices_df['date'])
monthly_sales = invoices_df.groupby(invoices_df['date'].dt.to_period('M'))['amount'].sum()

# Product/service performance
product_performance = invoices_df.groupby('product_name').agg({
    'amount': ['sum', 'count'],
    'client_id': 'nunique'  # Number of unique customers
})
3. Payment Pattern Analysis
python# Payment timing analysis
payments_df = pd.read_csv('invoice_ninja_payments.csv')
invoices_df['days_to_pay'] = (pd.to_datetime(payments_df['date']) - 
                             pd.to_datetime(invoices_df['date'])).dt.days

# Identify slow-paying customers
slow_payers = invoices_df[invoices_df['days_to_pay'] > 30]['client_id'].value_counts()
4. Revenue Forecasting
python# Seasonal trends
invoices_df['month'] = invoices_df['date'].dt.month
seasonal_trends = invoices_df.groupby('month')['amount'].mean()

# Growth rate calculation
monthly_growth = monthly_sales.pct_change() * 100
