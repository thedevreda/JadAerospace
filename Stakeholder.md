Hi Reda, thanks for bringing this dataset to me. Let’s go through it together. I’ll start by asking some business-oriented questions to help you clarify your goals and develop the right visualizations.

🔍 QUESTIONS FROM STAKEHOLDER:

Can you tell me how many parts fall under each Air System Category?

Which Risk Level is most common across parts?

Which part categories have the most High Risk parts?

Can we get a chart showing Risk Level per Air System Category?

What are the most common Replacement Intervals and how do they differ by Air System Category?

Can we visualize the distribution of replacement cycles?

Can you identify which parts are most associated with "harsh environments" or "older fleets"?

Can you build a tag-based word cloud or bar chart using the Geographical Targets field?

Which parts are “high risk” but have long replacement intervals? That could suggest overlooked risks.
